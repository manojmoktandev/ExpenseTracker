Expense Tracker App
Overview
The Expense Tracker App is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript to help users manage their personal finances. Users can add, view, edit, and delete expenses, categorize transactions, and view summaries of their spending. The app leverages Next.js's App Router for efficient routing and TypeScript for type-safe development.
