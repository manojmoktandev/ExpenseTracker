# Expense Tracker App

## Overview
The Expense Tracker App is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript to help users manage their personal finances. Users can add, view, edit, and delete expenses, categorize transactions, and view summaries of their spending. The app leverages Next.js's App Router for efficient routing and TypeScript for type-safe development.

## Features
- **Add Expenses**: Record new expenses with details like amount, category, and date.
- **View Expenses**: Display a list or dashboard of all expenses with filtering and sorting options.
- **Edit/Delete Expenses**: Modify or remove existing expense entries.
- **Categorization**: Organize expenses into categories (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities).
- **Summary Dashboard**: View total spending and breakdowns by category (optional: charts using a library like Chart.js).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for use on any device.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Linting**: ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript configurations
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended for Next.js apps)
- **Database**: (Optional: Specify if using a database like Supabase, Firebase, or local storage)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or pnpm (package manager)
- (Optional: Specify database or API prerequisites)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker-app.git
   cd expense-tracker-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or, if using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
   - Add necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs):
     ```bash
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
     ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Usage
- **Add an Expense**:
